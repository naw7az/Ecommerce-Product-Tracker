1. Cannot scrape data using request in amazon website, they have some fucking great engineers. So we are going to use
   selenium.

2. You can host this project on a webpage using Flask server.

3. The automation using selenium in this project will work like a human only(slow speed), otherwise amazon
   will know that this is run by a code.

4. Installing Vertual environment:
   1. go to folder where you wanna install venv using cmd
   2. write 'python -m venv venv(this is name of folder)'
   3. To activate: 'venv(folder name)\Scripts\activate.bat'
   4. To deactivate: 'deactivate'

5. The requirements file tell us all the module which are needed, but usually only with selenium the code will work.
   the code to install all the module in requirements.txt is: pip install -r requirements.txt

6. What is going on in this project step by step:
   Step 1: Run the browser
   Step 2: Go to amazon website
   Step 3: Put the search bar name of items we are looking for(ps4, iphone etc)
   Step 4: Go through multiple pages and get our items links(scrape)
   Step 5: loop through each link, and get all the data from each product 
   Step 6: Create a report based on our data
